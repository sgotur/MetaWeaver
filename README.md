This project transforms metadata into actionable insights by automatically generating intelligent queries through a large language model (LLM). It executes those queries using Pandas to dynamically load, filter, and analyze data—returning structured, context-aware results. The system bridges natural-language understanding, metadata reasoning, and data analytics into one seamless pipeline for smart data exploration.
